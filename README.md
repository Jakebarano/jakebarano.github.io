## Game AI Final Blog Post - My Perspective


## Introduction
For the past couple of weeks Ben Stone [@Flowslikelightning](https://github.com/FlowLikeLightning), and myself have been working on An AI buddy that utilizes a Flocking Behavioral Technique and Astar search algorithm to create a AI buddy that follows the player and takes direction from player input. The project so far has been difficult at times and enjoyable at others, as of writing this, I can confidently say we have created a good Prototype that has potential for being well optimized and built upon in the future to create a robust AI companion.

## Techniques
Here are Explainations of the techniques used in our project, Flocking will be covered in a further depth since it was my main focus while providing support to Ben with the much more difficult Astar.

### Flocking Behavior

The Flocking behavior implemented in this project is based on the general flocking behavioral concept which combines 3 force components:

> #### Alignment Force


> #### Cohesion Force

> #### Seperation Force


### Astar Algorithm
